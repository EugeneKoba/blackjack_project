# BlackJack Game

This is a small project that I made with the help of FreeCodeCamp, while learning the basics of Javascript (Vanilla). It is a simple card game, where the objective is to score 21 Points.

## Game Rules

2 of Clubs = 2 Points
3 of Clubs = 3 Points
...
9 of Clubs = 9 Points
10 of Clibs = 10 Points

Jack, Queen or King of Clubs = 10 Points

Ace of Clubs = 11 Points

The Player can draw any number of cards you want, as long as you score exactly 21 Points! Any more than 21 Points will result in a Bust!
